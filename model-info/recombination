Recombination is explorative as it generates a lot of new genetic material.

I will stick to only showing examples for some of the basic crossover methods, namely n-point crossover and uniform crossover. Both of these crossover types are order-preservation implementations, 
meaning that they focus on preserving the order in which genes appear in an individual. There are more also adjacency-preservation implementations, namely partially mapped crossover (PMX) and edge crossover, 
which are more advanced but also would not really work for binary representations. Additionally, other advanced order-preservation implementations are order and cycle crossover, 
but these also would not work for binary implementations.

n-point crossover

n-point crossover is exactly like one-point crossover except that instead of splitting the parents at 1 index, they are split at n indices. The n indices are selected randomly.

Uniform crossover 

Uniform crossover acts like a coinflip for each individual gene in the parents. For each gene, both parents have a 50% chance that their gene will be passed to the offspring.
