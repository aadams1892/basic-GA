Roulette Wheel Selection

In roulette wheel selection, we calculate the total fitness of the entire population, select a target fitness, and cumulatively add the fitness of individuals until we reach the target fitness. The parent whose fitness brings the cumulative fitness beyond the target fitness is selected as the parent. We then add this parent to a mating pool and repeat this process until the mating pool is full. Individuals in the mating pool are selected to produce offspring.

Tournament Selection

In tournament selection, in addition to the mating pool size, we also specify a tournament size (x). In each iteration of the function, we randomly select a subset of individuals of size x and rank them using the fitness function, with the highest fitness individual having rank 1. We then deterministically select the 2 fittest individuals to be the parents and move them to the mating pool. We repeat this process until we have filled the mating pool. We then select parents from the mating pool to produce offspring.
